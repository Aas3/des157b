It began as a university farm in 1905. In 1908, three years later, it opened its doors as the University Farm School. The school&rsquo;s main focus surrounded education, research, and agriculture. As the school grew, overtime, &nbsp;they began to expand their programs to include more than agriculture, and are now known as a renowned research university that prioritizes public service. Today, UC Davis is known for its excellence in teaching, research, and outreach across a wide range of disciplines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">Since my main topic for the capstone project will primarily focus on Davis&#39;s agriculture and its history, this source provides a brief breakdown of UC Davis&#39;s development. It discusses how Davis initially started, its main focus, and what it eventually developed into. With this information, I can create timelines on the development of Davis&#39;s agriculture. Since this source is from UC Davis&#39;s site itself, I believe its credibility is undisputed, and it could be considered a primary source.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">&quot;Davis Farmers Market.&quot; Davis Farmers Market, n.d., </span><span class="c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.davisfarmersmarket.org/about-us/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1683682748597478&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rwhc0GnDBCMsNABDVa9Gc">www.davisfarmersmarket.org/about-us/</a></span><span class="c9 c4">. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The source &#39;Davis Farmers Market&#39; talks about the Davis Farmers Market, including their association, mission, awards, board of directors, and history.
