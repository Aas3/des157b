                        <p class="sec3" data-scroll-to data-scroll>Davis's agricultural beginnings date back to the late 1800s when farmers settled in the region attracted by its fertile soil and favorable climate for agriculture. They began cultivating crops such as wheat, barley, oats, and raising livestock. These early settlers formed the foundation of Davis as an agricultural community.</p>

                        <p class="sec3" data-scroll-to data-scroll>Davis began as a farming community in the late 1800s, attracting settlers with its fertile soil and favorable climate. The establishment of the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in 1905 played a key role in shaping the city's agricultural identity. UC Davis conducted research, introduced rice cultivation, and innovative farming practices. Davis became known for its dairy industry and embraced organic farming and sustainable agriculture. UC Davis's renowned College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences has trained generations of farmers and contributed to agricultural advancements.</p>

                        <p class="sec3" data-scroll-to data-scroll>The Davis Farmers Market started in 1976 when a group of Davis residents came together to create a marketplace for local farmers to directly sell their fresh produce.

It operates year-round, offering not only fresh produce but also artisanal foods, crafts, and live music. The market serves as a platform for connecting farmers with the community, promoting sustainability, and fostering community engagement.</p>

In downtown Davis. “The seal is framed by a branch of the Valley Oak tree on one side, representing the original landscape and livelihood of the indigenous people.  On the other side is a branch of the olive tree, one of the agricultural species introduced by our early farmers. Both trees continue to grace our landscape, and serve as inspirational symbols of strength and peace.” </p>
