        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>The topic of my project will be Davis's agriculture from its beginning to the present day. The viewport for my topic will be in desktop view. My project connects to the seal because it primarily focuses on Davis's beginnings and its agricultural development, which is something referenced within the seal.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>My primary goal is to educate people who are not familiar with the Davis area about its origins and how it became known for agriculture. My secondary goal is to provide information on the types of crops grown in Davis and how the school contributes to agriculture. My project aims to benefit users by providing information specifically about Davis, its origins, the school, and its agriculture.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>Since I intend for my website to contain a substantial amount of information, I would like the visuals to juxtapose the serious nature typically associated with informative content. To achieve this, I plan to use bright colors and have considered combining photography with graphics. This approach will help create a lighthearted and playful feel that I aim to achieve.</p>
