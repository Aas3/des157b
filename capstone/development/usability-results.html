                <li>Started to scroll horizontally</li>
                <li>Liked the video in the background</li>
                <li>Make the video pausabe, add a signifier for it too</li>
                <li>Colors can be UC Davis colors</li>
                <li>Can add davis related graphics (ie. an egghead) </li>

            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Tester 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Didn't know the screen ended</li>
                <li>Was confused about the black screen</li>
                <li>Make the black in the video fade less harsh and shorter</li>
                <li>(when images are added) add text that signifies that the images are clickable or hoverable. </li>
                <li>Signify the end of the webpage</li>
                <li>If the webpage has a lot of content, add a scroll to start at the end</li>
            </ul>


            <p>After testing my website with a few of my peers, I received a lot of good feedback and suggestions to improve the user's experience. My first tester mentioned adding graphic elements and editing the video to make it more subtle. They also suggested making the video pausable so that users who may feel unsettled by the movement could have the ability to pause it. My second tester had some suggestions for the video as well. They recommended changing the fadeout color to something less harsh because, at first, they thought the video had stopped due to being on a certain section. They also suggested adding signifiers to indicate interactive elements to users. Based on the feedback I received from today's user testing, I plan to update my current features and incorporate additional ones suggested by my testers. I believe these updates will improve usability and the overall user experience. </p>
