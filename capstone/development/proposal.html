        <p>My topic of interest is agriculture, and my target audience are middle schoolers. My project aims to showcase the rich history of agriculture in Davis, and the types of crops that are currently being grown in the area. I plan to work on this project independently and envision it to have several features such as transitions, timed animations, and the incorporation of images and illustrations to make it more visually interesting.

         One of my main goals of this project is to provide insight into Davis's agriculture history by highlighting its past, present, and possible future. While I am still refining my ideas and developing a specific design, at this point, I have not encountered any significant challenges, concerns, or tangents related to my project. However, as I continue to work on it, I may encounter new ideas or issues that require further consideration. Regardless, I am eager to see how this project will develop and how it will be received by the audience.
